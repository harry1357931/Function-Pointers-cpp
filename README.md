Function-Pointers-cpp
=====================

This repository contains programs that demonstrates the concept of Function Pointers in C++.
The program is fairly easy to understand even if you are not a programming expert. 
Just Open the .cpp file and run the program, No input is reqd.

About Function Pointer:
=======================

A function pointer (or subroutine pointer) is a type of pointer supported by third-generation programming 
languages (such as PL/I, COBOL, Fortran 2003, dBASE dBL, and C) and object-oriented programming languages 
(such as C++ and D).[1] Instead of referring to data values, a function pointer points to executable code 
within memory. When dereferenced, a function pointer can be used to invoke the function it points to and pass 
it arguments just like a normal function call. Such an invocation is also known as an "indirect" call, because 
the function is being invoked indirectly through a variable instead of directly through a fixed name or address. 
Function pointers can be used to simplify code by providing a simple way to select a function to execute based on 
run-time values.
